jiraproxy
=========

A simple web application that provides a simple way to author custom HTML forms for creating JIRA issues.

Why?
----

At work we are using JIRA as a simple ticketing system and wanted a way to create simple (or complex) HTML forms that would gather all the information that we needed to fulfill the ticket and format it in the JIRA summary and description fields.  This simple utility allows all of the configuration to be posted with the form, allowing different ticket "entry points" to be configured in individual HTML forms without having to add any additional fields, issue types, or forms within JIRA itself.
